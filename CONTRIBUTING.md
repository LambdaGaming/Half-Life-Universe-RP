# Contributing Guidelines
Thanks for being interested in contributing! Before you start, please read through the following guidelines. Most of these are not strictly enforced, but following all of them would be greatly appreciated by myself and other contributors. I reserve the right to reject a pull request or ignore an issue for any reason, though this rarely happens.

## AI Policy
I expect your submissions to be authentic. Do not use any sort of generative AI to create issues, artwork, sounds, etc. Using AI tools to help you write code or documentation is acceptable, but only if you fully understand everything you're submitting. If I have reason to believe your submission violates this policy, it will be rejected without further discussion. Repeat offenders and bot accounts will be permanently banned from contributing to any of my repos.

## Issues
- All bug reports, feature requests, etc. should be discussed on our [Discord.](https://discord.gg/9RGdUS2)

## Pull Requests
- Keep your PRs simple and directed towards a single change. If you want to change or add multiple unrelated things, make separate PRs for each of them.
- Any large changes you plan on making or new features you want to add should be discussed with me ahead of time. This will ensure you don't waste time on something that I end up rejecting.
- Use conventional programming methods and keep your formatting consistent with what's already written. Try to avoid doing unusual things that might leave others confused, and add comments next to or above any code that might need an explanation.
- Optimize your code as much as possible, but prioritize readability over micro-optimizations.
- Make sure everything works properly before submitting the PR. In most cases I will test it myself before accepting, but having it work the first time makes it easier for both of us.
