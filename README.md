# Half-Life Universe RP
This repo contains all of the original code written for the Lambda Gaming Half-Life Universe RP server. This is not the full server. It is meant to be used for reference purposes only, as most of the code here will not work properly out of the box. More information about this server can be found [here.](https://lambdagaming.github.io/hlurp/main.html)

If you have any suggestions or questions about the server or this repo, please discuss them on our Discord. I will accept PRs for bug, exploit, and optimization fixes without prior discussion as long as you explain everything that you changed. I will not accept PRs for anything else without prior discussion and approval.
